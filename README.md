# Assets Folder for WPGulp

I created this repository to help myself. Anyone who finds this useful may use it. 

While searching around for the best way to develop WordPress themes using Bootstrap, I stumbled upon this wonderful article by Steve Polito https://stevepolito.design/blog/create-a-bootstrap-theme-for-wordpress/. This repo contains only the asset folder he organizes for [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) (By Ahmed Awais). 

I found if so useful, I created this repo so I don't have to move and copy files around everytime. 

Big Thanks to Steve Polito, Ahmed Awais, and the Bootstrap team.

The Bootstrap version used in this repo is v4.3.1
